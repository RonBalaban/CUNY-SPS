A three-digit number has two properties. The tens-digit and the ones-digit add up to 5. If the number is written with the digits in the reverse order, and then subtracted from the original number, the result is 792. Use a system of equations to find all of the 3-digit numbers with these properties.


Define an unknown 3-digit number:  abc
a = hundreds place
b = tens place
c = ones place


Represent each as a single digit with the corresponding multiplier (so if a = 3, 100a  = 300)
abc;
100a + 10b + 1c


We're given 2 properties;
1) b + c = 5  -> b = 5 - c
2) abc - cba = 792


Reverse order
cba;
100c + 10b + 1a



abc - cba = 792
(100a + 10b + 1c) - (100c + 10b + 1a) = 792
100a + 10b + 1c - 100c - 10b - 1a = 792
99a  - 99c  = 792
a - c = 8



We're left with the following sets;
b + c = 5
a = 8 + c



Digits can only range from 0 - 9, this narrows a to be values of 8 and 9 (therefore c can only have values of 0 and 1)
Therefore b can have values of 5 or 4


The solutions are therefore;
a = 8, b = 5, c = 0
a = 9, b = 4, c = 1


850 and 641
