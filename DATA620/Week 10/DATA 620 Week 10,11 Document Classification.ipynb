    "### It can be useful to be able to classify new \"test\" documents using already classified \"training\" documents.  A common example is using a corpus of labeled spam and ham (non-spam) e-mails to predict whether or not a new document is spam.  Here is one example of such data:  UCI Machine Learning Repository: Spambase Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/94/spambase)\n",
    "\n",
    "### For this project, you can either use the above dataset to predict the class of new documents (either withheld from the training dataset or from another source, such as your own spam folder).\n",
    "\n",
    "### For more adventurous students, you are welcome (encouraged!) to come up with a different set of documents (including scraped web pages) that have already been classified (e.g., tagged), then analyze these documents to predict how new documents should be classified."

    "### Overall, Linear Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression perform nearly identically, with a high 92.5% accuracy and low standard deviations, hence the models are stable. Precision checks the proportion of all the emails predicted as spam, what fraction actually were spam (True Positive). Recall checks the proportion of all actual spam emails, what fraction was identified correctly. These metrics are 92.1% and 88.6% respectively, so the Max Entropy and SVM models rarely label good emails as spam and catch most actual spam emails. F1 is the balanced harmonic mean of these two metrics, and is 90% for both. Now the model is trained, cross-validated, and ready to be used with new data. I will use Kaggle's SMS Spam collection dataset, to see how a model trained on email data performs with text-message data."
